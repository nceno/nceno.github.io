//I can obtain a list of "goal_object"s and a list of "participant_object"s by using "web3.py" that queries the ethereum blockchain/smartcontract
//I want to be able to gather interesting statistics and plots from collections/mergers/relations of the two lists, using pandas and seaborn.
//Question: Do these two objects need to be broken up further since there are 1d and 2d arrays as values?
