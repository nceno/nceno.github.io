                      <p>Nceno is not a fitness tracking app, nor is it a gambling app. Nceno is a platform for enforcing and monetizing adherence to healthy habits.</p>

                      <p>By combining blockchain smart contracts and digital health devices, Nceno creates a sort of Decentralized Internet of Things around healthy habit-building. Our vision is that soon everyone will be able to take charge of their own vice, be it: physical laziness, alcohol or smoking addiction, or medication compliance; in a way that is trustless, secure, and sovereign. </p>

                      <p>Our mission is to provide the platform enabling this vision of Sovereign Wellness, and to build a community of users to bolster its efficacy, all while focusing on bridging the gap between blockchain + IoT and a good user experience.</p>

                      <h2><strong>The Problem: Adherence</strong></h2>
                      <p>There are many apps that can help you track your progress toward your wellness and fitness goals, but what’s actually enforcing it?</p>

                      <p>The problem with fitness isn't a problem of motivating people to set a goal, or even getting people to make steady progress toward the goal. The problem is getting them to stick with it all the way to the end. This is called the "adherence" problem.</p>

                      <p>Here are some interesting stats about fitness adherence.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/blogs/eat-run/articles/2015-12-29/why-80-percent-of-new-years-resolutions-fail" target="_blank" >43% of new years resolutions are about losing weight. It only takes 4 weeks for 80% of these to fail, and long-term adherence is only 8%</a></li>
                        <li><a href="https://www.digitalpulse.pwc.com.au/2016-wearable-statistics-report/" target="_blank" >Almost half of all smart phone users have downloaded a fitness app, but 75% of them stop using them because there are no incentives.</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/article/print-view/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504" target="_blank">82 percent of people who buy gym memberships don't use them consistently</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthy_people/hp2010.htm" target="_blank">Less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day and only one in three adults receive the recommended amount of physical activity each week</a></li>
                        
                        
                      </ul>

                      <p>Until Nceno, there have been few tools available to the person who has “tried everything”. And the tools that are available require intrusive means by which to verify that progress is made; and furthermore, there is little incentive to use them.</p>

                    <div class="tab-pane show " id="demo-5-2" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="demo-5-2">
                      <h2><strong>Nceno's Solution: Loss-Aversion + Shared Rewards</strong></h2>

                      <p>What can be done about the adherence problem? It turns out that the pain of losing something you already have is stronger than the pleasure of gaining something you didn’t have. It's called "loss-aversion". Nceno takes advantage of this concept by providing digital accountability in the form of an escrow account linked to your fitness tracker (read more about the details in the next section.)</p>
                      
                      <p>Interventions based on loss-aversion have been shown to be even more effective than ones based purely on reward. What’s more remarkable is that even 13 weeks after the intervention, subjects in the loss-aversion group had higher adherence than either of the reward or control groups. Nceno takes advantage of both reward and loss-aversion to drive adherence that we've measured to be over 100% more effective than either one alone.</p>

                      <p>As of current, Nceno is a platform for fitness adherence. But in fact, it can be broken down into 4 main components; each are interchangeable and recombine to become a new tool for different goal paradigms. The components are: sensor, currency, rules, and goal paradigm.</p>

                      <p>When you complete a milestone you get part of your money back, and if you complete a whole week without missing one you get to claim the stake from people who didn’t. It's a double-edged sword though- If you fail to meet the weekly workout quota, part of your stake is lost and available to be claimed by those people in your challenge who actually met the quota. Nceno takes a cut of the lost stake, as well.</p>

                      <p>Nceno has the ability to help two different groups of people at the same time: those who need help forming a habit, and those who already have the habit formed and now want a way to monetize it. We will call this user relationship “influencer-follower”. In this scenario, a micro economy is formed by an influencer and their followers inside of a challenge that the influencer hosts.</p>

                        <a class="lightbox" href="app/assets/images/chart.png" title="Loss-aversion works">
                          <img src="app/assets/images/chart.png" >
                        </a>
                      </figure> -->
                      <p>Consider the role of an influencer- someone who inspires their followers using their presumed authority. In the case of fitness, the influencer already has a strong workout habit by virtue of necessity (think Instagram fitness influencer). Nceno gives them a way to host their normal weekly habit as a challenge that their followers likely have not yet developed. </p>
                       <figure class="photo">
                        <a class="lightbox" href="app/assets/images/influencer.jpg" title="influencer-follower diagram">
                          <img class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="app/assets/images/influencer.jpg" >
                        </a>
                      </figure> 
                      <p>Their followers are inclined to join, as it is a means for enhanced interaction. The influencer likely will not miss a milestone, while it is probable that many followers will, resulting in a profit for the influencer and maybe even for a few followers, though most will break-even or come short. Nevertheless, the followers will gain enhanced discipline to adhere to a workout promoted by someone they admire at a cost much less than a personal trainer, and the influencer will make money from workouts they were already planning to do. </p>
                      <p>Both sides win.</p>
                      <p> In addition to user segments, Nceno can also help two different classes of organizations. We will call this relationship “organization-consumer”. In this scenario, a micro economy is formed by an organization and their consumers inside of a challenge that the organization hosts.</p>
                      <!-- <figure class="photo">
                        <a class="lightbox" href="app/assets/images/chart.png" title="Loss-aversion works">
                          <img src="app/assets/images/chart.png" >
                        </a>
                      </figure> -->
                      <p>To understand why the organization might want to host a challenge, consider why their consumers’ involvement in Nceno challenges is valuable. Either: the consumer’s increased wellness means less risk for the organization, or else their involvement in a challenge means increased consumption of the organization’s product.</p>
                      <p>In exchange for their comsumers' involvement in Nceno challenges, the organizaiton might offer incentives of their own (in addition to Nceno's self-sustained shared group rewards) for the customers that meet certain success thresholds defined by the organization.</p>
                      <p>Now, we can see that, depending on the type of relationship, both sides do benefit from hosting/partaking in Nceno challenges. The exchange of value is illustrated in the figure below.</p>

                      <h2><strong>Why blockchain?</strong></h2>
                      <p>Many projects these days try to shoehorn blockchain into products where it adds no value. Perhaps a better way to say this, is that there is an incomplete grasp of blockchain’s purpose, limitations, threshold for value added, and the tradeoffs necessary to reach that threshold.</p>

                      <p>In the case of solving the problem of goal adherence, using blockchain-based smart contracts allows for trustless escrow and instant value transfer worldwide with transaction fees so low that we are able to subsidize them for the user.</p>

                      <p>Nceno’s upcoming features will take advantage of blockchain’s so-called “non-fungible tokens”. This will provide a non-counterfeitable and universally accessible means by which to display one’s progress toward a goal. Think of a “6 month sobriety chip” as issued in Alcoholic’s Anonymous, but one that cannot be faked. The same for exercise adherence. </p>

                      <p>Such “Proof-of-Progress” might be used as proof of sobriety for a parolee or recovering alcoholic when applying for jobs, or as proof of low-risk for a policyholder to negotiate a lower insurance premium.</p>

                      <p>As you might imagine, Nceno's use of blockchain technology reaches far beyond alternatives for financial vessels, all while avoiding the user experience headache of navigating such a cutting-edge paradigm. As the blockchain space matures and adoption is furthered by major players, Nceno will make further strives to incorporate blockchain into other solutions to adherence and sovereign wellness.</p>
