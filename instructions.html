        <h1>Welcome to the Nceno v0.1a (alpha)</h1>
        <p class="lead">Nceno is an app that is going to hold you accountable to the goals you are serious about keeping, but always have trouble sticking to long-term. Please keep in mind that this app is in its very early phase, and so the user interface looks a bit bare, and features are slimmed down. Nevertheless, your data and funds are safe; the functions holding them have been thoroughly tested and secured.</p>

        <p class="lead">Let's get started. To take part in this alpha test, you must download the wallet and send some crypto to it (see steps 1 and 2 on the main page). After that, you can set your goal and deposit your stake (like a security deposit on your goal progress).</p>

        <p class="lead">After your goal and stake are set, we will email you reminding you of your starting date. Each workout you perform, you will take a selfie right before and right after. Email these pictures to alpha@Nceno.app with your name in the subject line.</p>

         <p class="lead">After each workout, we will email you your overall status and how your progress compares to the other users'. As you make progress, you release parts of your stake which are immediately returned to your wallet. Even better, you will get additional rewards when other users skip one of their workouts. This goes both ways though, if you don't make all of your workouts for the week, part of your stake gets sent to others who did make progress. There are always a million reasons not to exercise. A goal worth setting is worth keeping, and using Nceno will make you think twice about skipping a workout that you set.</p>
