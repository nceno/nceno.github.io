            <p class="lead"><b>Nceno is a platform</b> to help you stick to your fitness goals and make money from your progress on them. Anyone can host a challenge and set a buy in, and anyone else can join in before it begins. As you accrue activity minutes as recognized by your fitness tracker, you can log them in your active challenges to receive a bit of your cash back, plus extra from the people who didn’t meet the weekly milestone. Likewise, if you don’t meet the weekly milestone, you lose the portion of your stake that was locked in that milestone. Read more here.</p>
            <hr class="w-25">
            <p style="color:black"><b>Before you host/join a challenge</b>, you must have a wearable from this list. You also must have some Ethereum, the lifeblood of Nceno. We use this as fuel to carry out transactions on the blockchain, and as a medium of currency. You should have enough to cover your stake, and your gas costs (which are refunded if you are 100% adherent for the week!) You will also be prompted to register for a Portis account upon making your first transaction on the blockchain. More on this below.</p>

            <h3>Sign in</h3>
            <p style="color:black">Assuming you have a compatible wearable, click &ldquo;link wearable&rdquo;. You will be prompted to sign in with fitbit. Accept the permissions when asked.</p>
            <p style="color:black">Next, you need to activate the blockchain. If you have metamask installed in your browser, go to extensions and disable it. Nceno uses Portis for transaction handling and wallet services, and it won&rsquo;t work if metamask is enabled. Click &ldquo;activate blockchain&rdquo; and a window will pop up. Register for a new wallet or sign in and you will see your wallet balance. Now is the time to send some ether to this wallet. Click the settings tab and &ldquo;receive&rdquo;. Send ether here how you normally would. If you don&rsquo;t know how, here&rsquo;s a good resource. After you have ether in this wallet, close the window</p>

            <h3>Register</h3>
            <p style="color:black">You need to make a profile on Nceno to make challenges. You need to use a real email address in case we need to contact you. Fill in the fields and click &ldquo;create account&rdquo;. This is your first transaction on Nceno. How exciting! You&rsquo;ll get a popup from Portis asking you to confirm the transaction. Blockchain transactions cost Ether to make happen, so it will show you how much eth it takes (in USD) and asks you to confirm. Do it, and wait a few seconds while it updates the blockchain. You will see &ldquo;success&rdquo; if everything went through ok. Note: you may only have one profile associated to each wearable</p>
            <h3>Host</h3>
            <p style="color:black">With Nceno, you can either make a new challenge or join one that someone else made. If you want to make a new one, open the Host tab and you&rsquo;ll see a few sliders that define the parameters of your goal/challenge. Adjust them to something you aspire to achieve, and can realistically see yourself making weekly progress on</p>
            <ul>
            <li style="color:grey"><strong>Side notes:</strong> Others will be able to see this challenge and join you before it begins. Thus, if you set the buy-in at $50 and 10 people join, that&rsquo;s $500 that is up for grabs for the people who complete the goal. If you set the intensity/frequency as only 20mins 2x week for 2 weeks, do you think many people will have a hard time doing that? Probably not, so the end result will just be everyone earning their own stake back, not making a profit, and not incurring a loss. Many people can see how this plays out, and thus will not join a challenge that is not considered &ldquo;challenging&rdquo;. So if your goal is to make a profit, choose your parameters accordingly. If you just want to use Nceno for personal accountability, that&rsquo;s perfectly fine, and you should choose whatever you want</li>
            <li style="color:grey">You will notice the date selection begins from the day after the day you are setting the challenge. This is so other people will have a bit of time to see and join the challenge. Don&rsquo;t worry, the calendar takes into account time zone differences as well. Your challenge will begin automatically at 12:01am on the day you choose</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color:black">When everything looks good, click the box that confirms you&rsquo;ve read these instructions and the terms of use. A button will appear for you to create the challenge. Click it and a dialogue will appear summarizing your challenge. Again, if everything seems fine, click &ldquo;create&rdquo; and you will be prompted by portis to confirm the transaction. The $ amount reflects both the stake you set and the gas fee. Confirm, and wait for your goal and stake to be locked on the blockchain. If everything goes fine, you will see &ldquo;success</p>
            <p style="color:black">Your goal will start automatically. It&rsquo;s up to you to keep your wearable synced to your phone, and to log workouts the same day you complete them. More on this below.</p>
            <h3>Manage</h3>
            <p style="color:black">Here is where you can see your live stats and log workouts and claim bonuses from the people who didn&rsquo;t workout</p>
            <p style="color:black">Everything on this page is self-explanatory. However, the most important thing is the week-by-week breakdown. Select the goal you want to manage from the dropdown. You will see a summary of its parameters. In the week-by-week, you will see several cards, one for each week of the challenge. You will see some stats on them, but more importantly, you will see two controls: log and claim</p>
            <ul>
            <li style="color:grey"><strong>Log:</strong> if you just completed a work out and the data has been synced to your phone, click &ldquo;log&rdquo;. Nceno will talk with your wearable&rsquo;s data server and determine whether your activity met or exceeded what you committed to in your goal by comparing it with the blockchain. If you did your part, you&rsquo;ll automatically be refunded a portion of your stake! If not, that same portion gets sent to the &ldquo;bonus bucket&rdquo;. More on this below</li>
            <li style="color:grey"><strong>Claim:</strong> if you were 100% successful in the previous week of your challenge (i.e. it is now week 2 and on week 1, you completed 3 of 3 workout sessions), you have permission to claim the lost stake of others, plus the ether you spent on gas. If this is the case, you can click &ldquo;claim&rdquo; and get your bonus</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="color:black">Note: your activity minutes can be &ldquo;double-logged&rdquo; in multiple challenges. For example, if you just did 40mins of activity and you&rsquo;ve joined 3 challenges, you can log 40mins for each challenge on the same day!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row justify-content-center">
          <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8">
            <h2><strong>During the challenge</strong></h2>
            <h3>Rules:</h3>
            <p style="color:black">Log however many activity minutes you want to; but note that surplus minutes do not affect your payout, progress, or standing in a challenge. (i.e. if your challenge is for 30mins 2x per week and you do 45mins 2x per week, or 30mins 3x per week, the result is the same as doing just 30mins 2x per week. Similarly, if you were to do one 20min workout and one 40min workout on separate days, the result is the same as if you only did one 30min workout and you would have to log an additional day containing the appropriate number of minutes.</p>
            <p style="color:black">The bottom line is that Nceno simply looks for the appropriate number of days in a week, each containing at least as many activity minutes as are set in the challenge parameters.</p>
            <p style="color:black">Cheating in the form of false reporting is made nearly impossible by our use of sensor fusion algorithms and machine learning. However, if a user is caught cheating via this or other means, their stake will be frozen, the case investigated, and their stake automatically redistributed to their challenge participants. They will be permanently banned from the platform and legal action will be taken against them.</p>
            <p style="color:black"><strong>What&rsquo;s an activity minute?</strong> Nceno uses a combination of motion and heart rate data as recorded by your fitness tracker to identify to what extent exercise is being performed and for how many minutes. Rest assured, if you are exercising in a capacity exceeding a normal walking pace, your activity will count. Tip: elevated heart rate matters more than steps counted. If you regularly sync your tracker with your phone, Nceno will display the number of minutes you have available to log on the Manage tab as a quick-stat before you decide to log them.</p>
            <p style="color:black">A single participant (person) may not enter a single challenge representing multiple participants. And yes, thanks to the wonders of science, we have ways of detecting this ;)</p>
            <h3>After the challenge</h3>
            <p style="color:black">Alright, so you set or joined a challenge, regularly did your workouts, even made a nice little profit. Now what?</p>
            <p style="color:black">Well, for starters, your challenge will still be visible under the Manage tab as a completed challenge. You can see the stats and week-by-week breakdown.</p>
            <p style="color:black">But how about your money? Well, you could roll it over to a new challenge. Or, you can take your winnings and cash out. See below.</p>
            <p style="color:black"><strong>Cashing out</strong></p>
            <p style="color:black">Currently, Nceno is based on the cryptocurrency Ethereum which is widely available to purchase and convert with USD and other currencies. There are even debit cards you can purchase which can hold your ETH and BTC so you can spend them like real money without going through your bank. Options differ depending where you live, but here are some resources to get you started.</p>
            <ul>
            <li style="color:grey">Coinbase- to bank or to paypal</li>
            <li style="color:grey">Maicoin- to bank</li>
            <li style="color:grey">Bitpay- refillable debit card</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="color:black">A note on cashing out: A common question is &ldquo;crypto is so volatile. What happens if the market takes a dive while my stake is locked up?&rdquo; Nceno uses the magic of stablecoins on our backend, so your $50 now, is your same $50 later, no matter what happens to the market. Alternatively, crypto traders might want to know what happens if the market shoots way up while their ETH is locked in Nceno. Same story, your stake is pegged to the USD. However, in the future, we are implementing many additional features for advanced users- one of which is the option to &ldquo;unpeg&rdquo; their stake (in the case of a sudden bull market).</p>

In fact, so long as you complete the workouts you set or agree to, the worst that can happen is that you earn all of your money back (even transaction fees!). Statistically, participants complete about 80% of their workouts, so if you just do your part, you stand to receive 120% of your buy-in when you complete a challenge with 100% adherence!</p>
