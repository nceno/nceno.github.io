                      <p>If you are a quick learner, we suggest watchign the quickstart video below that covers all of the following steps in this guide.</p>

                      <h2><strong>Log in and setup</strong></h2>
                      <p>From the Nceno app page, click "log in with strava". You will be shown the Strava login screen. It is ok to sign into Strava with google or facebook. Just make sure your wearable is linked to the account you choose. After you log in, you will be redirected back to the app page.</p>
                      <p>Optional- <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/508720" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join our club</a> on Strava to see full profiles and interact with other users.</p>

                      <p>Nceno lives on a special branch of the internet that gives us better security for handling money and data, so we need to use a special "wallet" called <a href="http://www.portis.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portis</a> to let users interact with it. So when you click "activate blockchain", a window&nbsp;pops up asking you to sign in or create a Portis account.</p> 
                      <p>Follow the steps, and then send some ETH to your portis wallet. Once you're done, close the window. If successful, you'll see your wallet address on the app page.</p>

                      <p>The first time you use Nceno, a profile will be automatically generated for you. It will be stored and used to associate your wearable to your challenges, rewards, and progress. So go ahead and click "create profile". This is the one and only time you will be asked to do it.</p>
                      <p>This is also your very first Ethereum transaction! You will be prompted to confirm the transaction with Portis.</p>

Note: everyone in a challenge has to stake the same amount (in USD). If you see one you like, click Join. You will see a window sumarizing your commitment. If everything looks good, confirm it. You will then be asked by Portis to confirm the transaction (because your stake will automatically be deposited).</p>

                      <p>If you don't see a challenge you like, you can set a new one. Go to the "host" tab, and use the sliders to set a custom challenge. Note: the earliest start date is the next day, to give people a chance to see it and join. You can also set a challenge to begin at any later date. Don't worry about the time zone issues, we've taken care of it.</p>
                      <p>Once you have set the parameters to your liking, accept the terms and click host. You will be shown a summary of the challenge as well as its unique ID. If everything looks good, confirm it with Portis. Wait a few seconds while Portis works its magic. If everything went well, your challenge will be available for anyone to join, just how you saw the upcoming challenges in the "browse" tab.</p>
                      <p>If you want to invite your friends, just send them the challenge ID, and have them search for it in the "browse" tab.</p>

                      <h2><strong>Logging workouts and claiming stake</strong></h2>
                      <p>Ok, so your challenge has started. How do you get your money back? Simple... workout! When you do a workout, make sure it appeared in your Strava activity, and head over to the "manage" tab and check out "week-by-week breakdown". <strong>Important: You must log your workout on the same day you finished it.</strong></p>
                      <p>You'll see a card for each week of the challenge. Click the appropriate week, and click "log". You will be asked to confirm the transaction with Portis. Nceno checks with Strava and your wearable to make sure your workout is the same intensity that you commited to in the challenge. If all is good, you will be paid back a portion of your stake immediately. Check your wallet after a few seconds.</p>
                      <p>On the same page, you can also view a leaderboard to see how others are doing, as well as your own detailed private stats.</p>

                      <p>Alright, so you know that Nceno can help motivate you to workout (because if you don't, you lose money). But where does the lost stake go?</p>
                      <p>Answer: To the people who actually <em>did</em> all of the workouts for the week.</p>
                      <p>That applies to you as well! If you did 100% of the workouts for the week, then the following week, you are considered a "winner" and can claim an equal portion of the stake lost by others (i.e. the stake from un-logged workouts).</p>
                      <p>Follow the same steps as you did to log, but click "claim" instead. <strong>Important: you can only claim lost stake from the previous week. This is so that everyone can schedule their workouts at any time during the week.</strong></p>

                      <p>Ok, the challenge has ended, and you have made a nice little profit, or maybe not... Anyhow, as long as you logged at least one workout, you should have some crypto in your wallet. (It will be DAI instead of ETH.)</p>
                      <p>You can keep it in your wallet for later, convert it into ETH again and start a new challenge, or cash out. If you want to exchange it, go to the sign in page and click "convert". You can use this tool to instantly convert it into several different Ethereum-based tokens. Set up the conversion, and confirm the transaction with Portis. Your tokens will be in your wallet shortly. Note: you must have a bit (~$1.00) of ETH in your wallet to do a conversion.</p>
                      <p>If you're just trying to convert it into paper money (or your bank), convert it to ETH and send the ETH to <a href="http://www.coinbase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an appropriate exchange</a>. To send ETH or tokens, open Portis from the internet or from Nceno, and click "send". Enter the address and amount, and authorize the transaction. It's a good idea to check the destination account to make sure the funds were sent successfully.&nbsp;</p>

                              <p style="color:black">We have users from all over the world. Using crypto as the medium of value lets us avoid banking jurisdictions, limits the information we need from individuals, reduces the transfer fees to zero (or at least low enough so that we can afford to pay them for you!), and allows for instant micro transactions between users. Blockchain makes these transfers more secure by using something called “smart contracts” to hold the funds, only releasing them when certain conditions are met (like when you record a workout that is consistent with your challenge). Blockchain also allows you to have an uncounterfeitable record of your progress!</p>

Thus, it is not possible to shake your wearable to log a “walk”, or artificially elevate your heart rate and sit in the corner to log an “HIIT” session. This does not rule out the scenario that someone has their friend do the workout for them, but that would be similar to the case where a real athlete joins your challenge. Realize that even if someone does this, they only stand to win their own stake, as long as you do all of your workouts. Finally, Nceno has a strict no-cheating policy. If any users are found to be conspiring to gain an unfair advantage against other users in the same challenge, their stake will be frozen and redistributed to the victims.

The cool thing about DAI is that 1 DAI is almost always equal to 1 USD, no matter what the rest of the crypto market is doing. We say almost because the price still fluctuates within 1 or 2 cents above and below a dollar. When you deposit your stake, it is converted to DAI, and paid back to you when you log or claim. If you want to convert it back to ETH or a different token, just use the conversion tool on the Nceno app page. Also see: Isn’t ETH volatile? What happens to my stake if the market fluctuates?</p>

At this stage, we cannot see how a native token would add to the value of Nceno. However, we are hard at work deriving an economic model and feature set for which a native token would not only increase the efficacy of the platform, but also increase the network value of such a token. Stay tuned for further developments.</p>
