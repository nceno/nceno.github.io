        <h1>Get some crypto</h1>
        <p class="lead">Now that you have your wallet set up, you can use it to store some crypto. But first you have to get some. Nceno uses a cryptocurrency called "Ethereum". Now, some of you already own some Ethereum. If you do, then just send it to your Cipher or Status wallet. If you don't, then we're going to help you.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Cryptocurrency works like cash, only faster, safer, cheaper, and more securely. For instance, you can send someone on the other side of the world $1,000 worth of Ethereum in a matter of seconds, without a bank, without giving your name (or knowing theirs), and it only costs a few pennies. The most important thing to understand here, is that millions of people around the world are buying and selling it every day with real money. It absolutely has real money value, so you can just think of it like a foreign currency (with an exchange rate). So we can say things like "$50 USD worth of Ethereum" or "0.7 ETH = $145 USD".</p>

        <p class="lead"> Alright, so if you don't already have Ethereum, you can buy some from an exchange (where people buy and sell it). There are literally hundreds on the internet, but it's slower than what we're gonna do. For our purposes, we're gonna do it the way people did before there were exchanges (like 5 years ago). You will send me via Paypal, Venmo, cash in person, or otherwise, the amount of stake you want to lock up for your workout progress in $USD (<a href="instructions.html">remember from here?</a>), and include your "wallet address" in a message. I will then send you that amount in ETH (shorthand for Ethereum) which will appear in your Cipher or Status wallet. </p>

        <h2>TLDR;</h2>
        <p class="lead">Step 1: Get your wallet address. </p>
        <p class="lead">In Cipher (iPhone users), click the bottom icon that looks like a wallet, then click the "receive" button that looks like a QR code. A large QR code should pop up with a bunch of numbers below it (for example, "0x27BD6D3fD046Fb3A6b073C55061f952873ADB0Cf"). The number you see is your public address. It is not a password, so it is safe to share with anyone (kind of like a username). Press the QR code, and it should copy the address. Then you can text it to yourself, email it, whatever.</p>
        <p class="lead">Step 2: Send me USD through the internet or in-person. Include your ETH wallet address in a message (the number you got from Step 1).</p>
        <p class="lead">Step 3: When I receive your cash, I will send you that much ETH to your wallet (using the address you gave me). This all takes only a few seconds.</p>
        <p class="lead">Step 4: No step 4! You're done! You now own cryptocurrency!  <a href="faq.html">Now go set a goal, and use it.</a></p>
